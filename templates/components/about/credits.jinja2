    <h3>Credits</h3>
    
    <p>EMLO is a genuinely collaborative effort amongst the Project’s 
    committed team of designers, developers, editors, librarians, managers, 
    researchers, and systems developers. Editorial and scholarly credits for
    our individual contributing catalogues may be found on the 
    <a href="http://emlo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/emlo_collections">Catalogue</a> pages. The software for the prototype catalogue and its editorial interface has been created by colleagues from <a href="http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/sers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BDLSS</a> of <a href="http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bodleian Libraries</a>.
    Our founding developer, Sue Burgess, helped specify EMLO-Edit, 
    hand-coded it from scratch, and helped knock the front-end functionality
    into shape after the private alpha launched in 2010. The mantle of 
    developer was then taken over by Renhart Gittens from 2013–14, who set 
    in place the foundations of the EMLO-Collect webform. Monica Messaggi 
    Kaya, our designer, was responsible for the catalogue’s look and feel 
    and worked tirelessly on its re-design in 2014. Matthew Wilcoxson 
    enhanced front-end functionality and built the first prototype (which 
    also benefited from additional coding from Anusha Ranganathan), and in 
    Phase II performed sterling work on both back end functionality and the 
    re-design. We also have Mat to thank for EMLO’s people bar charts, which
    he initially implemented with Scott Weingart from Indiana University. 
    Dr Iva Lelkova and Dr Robin Buning, our two postdocs, worked from 
    2013–15 on CofK’s prosopographical pilot projects. Digital Engineer 
    Tanya Gray Jones&nbsp;contributed fundamental technical work to this new
    area, including the definition of a semantic data model, the 
    development of a semantically enriched input form, and enabling the 
    process of data capture to data upload. From 2014 until 2019, Matthew 
    Wilcoxson was appointed lead developer and enhanced EMLO to meet every 
    fresh challenge encountered; from September 2019 to the present, this 
    role has been taken on by John Pybus.&nbsp;From the outset of CofK in 
    2009, overall technical direction has been provided by the Project’s 
    Technical Strategist, Neil Jefferies, who also manages the deeper 
    Bodleian-based infrastructure within which EMLO sits. Coordination and 
    project management was provided in Phases III and IV by Arno Bosse, in 
    Phase II by Dr Elizabeth Williamson, and in Phase I by Dr James Brown, 
    with assistance from Dr Kim McLean-Fiander, Erin Cooper, and Dr 
    Christine Madsen. Overall leadership of the project rests with our 
    Director <a href="http://www.culturesofknowledge.org/?page_id=5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professor Howard Hotson</a>. 
    EMLO’s editor <a href="http://www.culturesofknowledge.org/?page_id=5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miranda Lewis</a>
    has taken leadership on all things editorial since the outset of the 
    project, and is supported in editorial tasks by our team including&nbsp;
    <a href="http://www.culturesofknowledge.org/?page_id=5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assistant Editor Charlotte Marique</a>&nbsp;and an ever-changing number of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.culturesofknowledge.org/?page_id=5/#digitalfellows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EMLO Digital Fellows and volunteers</a>, whose tireless devotion and wonderful energy is an indispensable contribution to the project as a whole.</p>
    <p>The founding Steering Committee was indispensable to the 
    establishment and earliest phases of the project. Professor Pietro Corsi
    provided the initial conception and oversaw the crucial planning 
    stages. Dr Will Poole was particularly forthcoming with suggestions, 
    initiative and resources. Dr Robert McNamee kicked off development of 
    EMLO’s data model by sharing the standards developed by the Electronic 
    Enlightenment. Professor Richard Sharpe played the lead role in 
    tailoring the model for and implementing it on EMLO. Michael Popham 
    oversaw the scanning and keying of the Bodleian’s card catalogue of 
    manuscript correspondence. Professor Peter Harrison initially chaired 
    the Steering Committee: since his return to Australia this 
    responsibility has been shouldered by Sir Noel Malcolm. As the founding 
    Project Manager of Cultures of Knowledge, Dr James Brown made a massive 
    contribution to the origin and early development of EMLO.</p>
